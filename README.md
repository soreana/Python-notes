In python result of the / is float !!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The truncated division operator, //, also works on floating point numbers. It truncates to the nearest integer, but still produces a floating point result. Thus 7.0 // 3.0 is 2.0.

for example:

```python

print( 10 / 3 ) # prints 3.333333333
print( 10 // 3) # prints 3

```

** is the power sign.

```python

print( 4**2 ) # prints 16
```


Functions are objects in Python. So if I print out what's the value of square, then Python is going to tell me that square is a function. So if I run my code, you can see that line 1 prints out function square.

```python

def square():
    return none
    
print(square) # outputs <function square>
```


type function shows the type of the variable.

Use """ to split string in multiple lines.
