In python result of the / is float !!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The truncated division operator, //, also works on floating point numbers. It truncates to the nearest integer, but still produces a floating point result. Thus 7.0 // 3.0 is 2.0.

for example:

```python

print( 10 / 3 ) # prints 3.333333333
print( 10 // 3) # prints 3

```

** is the power sign.

```python

print( 4**2 ) # prints 16
```
